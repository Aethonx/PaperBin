# PaperBin 🗑️
An experiment at improving the performance of PaperMC. 

This project uses ASM and the attach api to modify Paper classes as they are defined.

Dont take this too seriously. I basically look at a profile and rate limit the functions that take the longest lol.

Usage:
```
java [any jvm arguments] -jar PaperBin.jar ActualPaper.jar [any paper arguments]
```

Commands `/binstop` and `/binstart` are recognised

PaperBin is 100% compatible with any forks of paper, so you dont have to use vanilla paper.
