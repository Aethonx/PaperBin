An experiment at improving the performance of PaperMC. 

This project uses ASM and the attach api to modify Paper classes as they are defined.
Because of this paperbin can even **be run on top of other paperforks**!

## Usage
Make sure you have read the License.
Then download paperbin and run the following command **using a version 8 JVM**, ideally either hotspot, openjdk or graal:
```
java [any jvm arguments] -noverify -jar PaperBin.jar ActualPaper.jar [any paper arguments]
```
